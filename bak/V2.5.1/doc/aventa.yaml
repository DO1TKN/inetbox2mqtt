# This YAML is part of the inetbox2mqtt project and is based on the automatically generated entities. 
#
# The library enables bidirectional interaction with the CPplus. 
# Thus, inputs can be made on the CPplus as well as on the HA. 
# This applies both to temperature changes and to switching on/off.

# Observe the associated frontend-card, which is optimally matched to it
